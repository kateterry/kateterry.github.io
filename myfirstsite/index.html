	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a powerlifter, travel junkie, and future developer based in Brooklyn, NY. As a child growing up in the suburbs of Washington D.C., I would constantly ask my father to tell and re-tell stories of his Naval deployments in foreign countries, and was endlessly fascinated by the cultural differences of my friends' homes--nearly all of whom were children of diplomats. I live for cultural awareness and Vietnamese food. In my free time I train at a powerlifting club in Gowanus, am an amateur cook, and am trying to cultivate a green thumb.</p>

		<p>For the last 6 years I have been working at the world's largest job site, Indeed.com. I currently lead a newly-formed, global team of product specialists who identify opportunity to apply solutions that mobile-enable employers' jobs on Indeed. We help people get jobs on mobile.</p>
